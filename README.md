# Newsweek clone

> In this project, we will replicate the archived version of the website Newsweek with bootstrap. This page is a clone of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210120125445/https://www.newsweek.com/">Newsweek Page</a>.
You can compare this web page with a real one via a demo link. The website is fully responsive with the help of three media query breakpoints. This project has been built with help of modern <button>CSS</button> and <button>Bootstrap</button>.

## Getting Started
First thing to do on the way of cloning this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210120125445/https://www.newsweek.com/">page</a> is getting the library of all pictures an icons. Than start to add all web page elements to html file. Second step is sorting elements into semantic and non-semantic tags. Than you can start to style them. But make sure you use bootstrap for everything if possible. Don't forget to complete fixed navbar and footer first.
