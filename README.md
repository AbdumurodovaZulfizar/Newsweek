## Getting Started
First thing to do on the way of cloning this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210120125445/https://www.newsweek.com/">page</a> is getting the library of all pictures an icons. Than start to add all web page elements to html file. Second step is sorting elements into semantic and non-semantic tags. Than you can start to style them. But make sure you use bootstrap for everything if possible. Don't forget to complete fixed navbar and footer first.
